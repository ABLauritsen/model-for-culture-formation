2. A zip-file of all the historical maps.

The folder "plotting-code" contains code to make various plots in the paper.

The folder "simulation-code" contains the code running the simulations:
1.	The files "mapdynamics_periodic_iter---.py" run on the European map.
2.	The files "torus---.py" run on the torus, i.e., with periodic boundary conditions.
